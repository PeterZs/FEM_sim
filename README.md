This figure is the result of dynamics FEM simulation of a hexahedron mesh.

Dynamics or quasi-static simulation of solid using finite element method and using different consti- tutive models such as linear elasticity, co-rotational linear elasticity,St. Venant-Kirchhoff model and Neohookean elasticity with tetrahedron mesh or hexahedron mesh.
